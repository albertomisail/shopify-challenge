# shopify-challenge
This is a demonstrative image repository.
The repository supports different users with login, logout, and reset password
You can do the following actions with the links in the home page:
1. Upload new image: Upload images you want to sell
2. Uploaded images: Check all the images you have uploades and delete the ones you don't want anymore
3. Load balance
4. Marketplace: Explore marketplace for new images to buy
5. Purchases: See your purchased images

## Usage
1. Install dependencies with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create your user doing `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
3. Run server `python3 manage.py runserver`

## Future Features
In the future I want to improve the UI. For this I would most likely rewrite it completely using ReactJs.
I also want to improve the search features, allowing the user to search for similar images, tags, etc.
